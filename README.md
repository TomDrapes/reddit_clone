## React Challenge by Tanda
This is my submission for the Tanda React Internship Challenge and was designed to fullfil the following user requirements.

**One:** Provide a list view of the 'Hot' posts.
**Two:** Provide a view containing more information about an individual post (including comments for the post). 
**Three:** Be able to share a link so others can view the comments for posts viewed on the clone.
**Four:** Sorting of posts and comments (hot, top, new, controversial, etc).
**Five:** Showing previews of videos and images if the post is a link to one of these things.
**Six:** Collapsing and expanding children comments in the post view.
**Seven:** Up-voting and down-voting posts and comments.
**Eight:** Commenting.
